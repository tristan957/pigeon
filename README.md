# Pigeon

A GTK API Development Tool similar to Postman and Insomnia.

Pigeon is **under heavy development**.

Pigeon, the name, is an omage to WW2 carrier pigeons that would carry messages
to soldiers. In this case, we are sending messages to servers.

## Motivation

I am tired of Electron apps ruling my life.
